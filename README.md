# Review-Text-Mining-NLP
This task involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and analyze raw customer reviews, ultimately extracting key business insights related to customer sentiment and identifying common complaint topics.

This project takes messy customer reviews and cleans them up so computers can understand them. The final goal is to use this analysis (like finding out if customers are happy or what they complain about) to give specific recommendations on how the company can improve its products and services.

Tht techniques used are Data Cleaning, Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization, Feature Extraction (TF-IDF/Word2Vec/Embeddings), Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling.
